If we assume B is a truth-teller, then C must be a truth-teller as well, but this means that D is also a truth-teller, which contradicts the initial condition that only two are truth-tellers. Hence, B cannot be a truth-teller. If we assume C is a truth-teller, then D must be a truth-teller as well, which satisfies the condition that exactly two are truth-tellers. Also, D's statement that B is a liar holds true in this case, as B is indeed a liar. Therefore, C is the truth-teller among A, B, and C.\"},\n",
